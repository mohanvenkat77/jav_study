1) Tell about yourself?
2) What are the OOPS concept and explain?
3) Abstract Class can have Constructor? What is the use?
4) Difference Between private variable with getter / setter and public variable?

there are much more advantages:

getters and setter can have validation in them, fields can't
using getter you can get subclass of wanted class.
getters and setters are polymorphic, fields aren't
debugging can be much simpler, because breakpoint can be placed inside one method not near many references of that given field.
they can hide implementation changes:
Some libraries require this to fulfill the "Java Bean standard".
A setter/getter can be in an interface, a property cannot be in an interface


5) static method can be overridden?
6) What is serialization?

7) How to protect the variable not to serialize?
	if you don't want any field to be part of object's state then declare it either 
	static or transient based on your need and it will not be included during Java serialization process

7) Narrow Conversion? wide and narrow primitive type casting
8) Difference b/w String and StringBuffer and StrinBuilder?
	String immutable (once created can not be changed ),threadsafe(no tow threads can change the value), stores the values in Constant String Pool  
	StringBuffer mutable( one can change the value of the object ), threadsafe, The object created through StringBuffer is stored in the heap 
	StringBuilder  is same as the StringBuffer , that is it stores the object in heap and it can also be modified,
	StringBuilder is also not thread safe. StringBuilder is fast as it is not thread safe.
	StringBuffer methods -> append, delete, reverse, insert,replace.
	
9) Difference b/w String ="" and String s = new String("");
 example
 *******
 String s = "Polish";
 String t = "Polish";
 
 Polish is a string is in String pool, then s and t actually refer to the 
 same object, and s==t will return true, for "==" for objects read "is the same object" 
 
 String s = new String("Polish");
 String t = new String("Polish");
 created in heap, both are different object. s!=t and   s.equals(t) will return true

Adapter pattern works as a bridge between two incompatible interfaces. This type of design pattern comes under 
structural pattern as this pattern combines the capability of two independent interfaces.

This pattern involves a single class which is responsible to join functionalities of independent or incompatible interfaces. 
A real life example could be a case of card reader which acts as an adapter between memory card and a laptop.
 You plugins the memory card into card reader and card reader into the laptop so that memory card can be read via laptop

10) What is aggregation and Composition in java and how to implement?

	Aggregation, Composition falls on Has-A relationship.
	Aggregation
		 WIll exist if the Whole is destroyed. for example an Engine could exist with or without a Car.
		 
		 public Class Car {

				private Engine engine;

				public void setEngine(Engine engine){
				 this.engine=engine;
				}  

				public Engine getEngine(){
				 return engine;
				}
		}
	Composition
		Will not exist if the object is destroyed. for example a Room can't exist without a House.
		public class House {
		   private Room room;
		   public House (int noRooms, String nameOfHouse){
			  room = new Room (noRooms,  nameOfHouse);

		   }
		}

11) How to get keys from HashMap?
	mapObj.keySet();
12) Difference b/w ArrayList and LinkedList?
	Both maintain the insertion order
	ArrayList
		Faster search  --> ArrayList maintains index based system for its elements 
				as it uses re sizable array data structure implicitly which makes it faster for searching an element in the list.
	
	LinkedList
		slow for search -->LinkedList implements doubly linked list which requires the 
					traversal through all the elements for searching an element.
	
	LinkedList has more memory overhead than ArrayList because in ArrayList each index 
	only holds actual object (data) but in case of LinkedList each node holds both data and address of next  and previous node.

				
	Difference b/w HashSet and TreeSet and LinkedHashSet?
		Set --> Unique elements
		HashSet --> Fast set, allow null, uses equals for comparision, doesn't maintain order
		LinkedHashSet --> 2nd Fast,allow null, uses equals for comparision,Insertion Order
		TreeSet -->  slow, doesnot allow null (NPE throws), compareTo() for comparision, Sorted
		
	
13) What are all the methods in Object class?
equals, hashCode, clone,toString,notify, notifyAll,wait,finalize

14) What is serialization? Where we need to use it?  
		If we dont implement the Serializable interface what is the exception we will get? In which layer we need to use Serializable?
15) volatile keyword?
	--> volatile keyword guarantees visibility of changes to variables across threads
	--> JVM guarantees that every read of the variable will always be read from main memory.
	--> Very expensive , since stores into main memory
	
16) GenericServlet and HttpServlet difference?

	Generic Servlet:
			GenericServlet class is direct subclass of Servlet interface.
			Generic Servlet is protocol independent.It handles all types  of protocol  like http, smtp, ftp etc.
			Generic Servlet only supports  service() method.It handles only simple request 
			public void service(ServletRequest req,ServletResponse res ).
			Generic Servlet only supports  service() method.
	HttpServlet:
			HttpServlet class is the direct subclass of Generic Servlet.
			HttpServlet is protocol dependent. It handles only http protocol.
			HttpServlet  supports public void service(ServletRequest req,ServletResponse res )
					and protected void service(HttpServletRequest req,HttpServletResponse res).
					
			HttpServlet supports also   doGet(),doPost(),doPut(),doDelete(),doHead(),doTrace(),doOptions()etc.

17) What is the method we need to implement when extends GenericServlet?
	service
18) GenericServlet class / Interface?
class

20) what are all the locks in hibernate?
21) In spring what is Dependency Injection?
22) Different scopes in bean definition? and its difference? when the object is created for each scope?	
singleton  - This scopes the bean definition to a single instance per Spring IoC container (default).
prototype  - This scopes a single bean definition to have any number of object instances.
request    - This scopes a bean definition to an HTTP request. Only valid in the context of a web-aware Spring ApplicationContext.
session    - This scopes a bean definition to an HTTP session. Only valid in the context of a web-aware Spring ApplicationContext.
