@Ishwarya – Could you please let us know what has to be set as proxy for git, which works.

Below is the proxy server details for GIT:

address: 10.68.248.102  port:80
Below are the working proxies for GIT:
     10.68.248.102
     10.68.248.98
     10.68.248.39

I have tried with all the three proxies and it is working fine,I was able to clone a sample git project.below are the commands to configure:

      git config --global http.proxy https://:@10.68.248.39:80
     git config --global http.proxy https://:@10.68.248.98:80
      git config --global http.proxy https://:@10.68.248.102:80
